    "text": "Hi! I’m Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at Posit, where (among other things) I lead the tidyverse team. I build tools (computational and cognitive) that make data science easier, faster, and more fun. I’m from New Zealand but I currently live in Houston, TX with my husband and dogs.\nIf you’d like to learn more about what I do, and how to use R effectively, you might enjoy one of my books (which are all free to read on the web):\n\nR for Data Science, with Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund, is the place to start if you want to learn how to do data science with R.\nggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis shows you how to use ggplot2 to create graphics that help you understand your data.\nAdvanced R helps you master R as a programming language, teaching you what makes R tick.\nR Packages, with Jenny Bryan, teaches good software engineering practices for R, using packages for bundling, documenting, and testing your code.\n\nOutside of work, I love to bake and make cocktails. My sister Charlotte also works for Posit as a Developer Educator."
