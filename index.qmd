Hi!
I'm Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at [Posit](https://posit.co), where (among other things) I lead the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) team.
I build tools (computational and cognitive) that make data science easier, faster, and more fun.
I'm from New Zealand but I currently live in Houston, TX with my husband and dogs.

If you'd like to learn more about what I do, and how to use R effectively, you might enjoy one of my books (which are all free to read on the web):

-   [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.hadley.nz/), with [Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel](https://mine-cr.com) and Garrett Grolemund, is the place to start if you want to learn how to do data science with R.

-   [ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org) shows you how to use ggplot2 to create graphics that help you understand your data.

-   [Advanced R](http://adv-r.hadley.nz/) helps you master R as a programming language, teaching you what makes R tick.

-   [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.org/), with [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/about/), teaches good software engineering practices for R, using packages for bundling, documenting, and testing your code.

Outside of work, I love to [bake](https://recipes.had.co.nz) and make [cocktails](https://cocktails.hadley.nz).
My sister [Charlotte](http://cwick.co.nz/) also works for Posit as a Developer Educator.
